# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where people can play from 2 different computers. There is a server gui where the information of all ther users that are connecting to the game can be tracked. 
Created by Luis Ojeda on 2019 for an assignment for SAIT.

# How to play
The server GUI shows real-time log of connections and game traffic of clients.

The client GUI allows the user to connect to the server, disconnect from it, send messages to the opponent and play a game of Tic Tac Toe.

The players can chat with each other during the game

The players can be reinstated to play via the server.

The players can play Tic Tac Toe at full functionality without any problem and multiple times.

When a player disconnect in the middle of the game, it notifies the opponent about it and tells them to wait for the next available opponent.

When a game ends, the players can decide whether to disconnect or continue the game. 

If one player chose to play again and the other player does not, the player who wanted to play again waits for the next available opponent.
